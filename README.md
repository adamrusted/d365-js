# D365-JS
A simple tool to generate condensed JS code for use in the D365 ecosystem.

To install, run `npm install` and write your JS into the `src/index.js` file (import and extend as needed!).

When you're ready to export, run `npm run build-prod` to create a production bundle which is suited to all major browsers.

`dist/bundle.js` contains your minified code.
